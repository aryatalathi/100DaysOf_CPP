You have N stacks of books. Each stack of books has some non zero height Hi equal to the number of books on that stack ( considering all the books are identical and each book has a height of 1 unit ). In one move, you can select any number of consecutive stacks of books such that the height of each selected stack of books Hi <= K . Once such a sequence of stacks is chosen , You can collect any number of books from the chosen sequence of stacks .
What is the maximum number of books that you can collect this way ?
